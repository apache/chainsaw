For General Users & log4j developers
=====================================
Firstly, you'll need maven 2.0.4+ to build Chainsaw:

http://maven.apache.org


Next, an interim step is required until log4j 1.2.15, log4j-components, log4j-receivers, and log4j-expression-filter are voted on and released:

* SVN check out the following projects:
	log4j-component - http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/logging/log4j/companions/component/trunk/
	log4j-pattern-layout - http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/logging/log4j/companions/pattern-layout/trunk/
	log4j-receivers - http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/logging/log4j/companions/receivers/trunk/
	log4j-filters - http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/logging/log4j/companions/filters/trunk/
	log4j-zeroconf - http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/logging/log4j/companions/zeroconf/trunk/

  while Chainsaw has a marked dependency on log4j 1.2.15, building log4j-zeroconf requires log4j 1.2.16-SNAPSHOT, so you will also need to get:
  
  log4j - https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/logging/log4j/trunk
	
	
  In each of these checkout directories:
  	mvn install

  This will install into your local maven repository the correct SNAPSHOT releases of the required dependencies. 
  These dependencies are not yet available in the standard maven repositories, and so failure to complete this 
  step will prevent you from building Chainsaw.


* cd to Chainsaw project checkout directory

	mvn install

This will automatically build and assemble the Chainsaw distribution which includes a .sh & .bat shell script to run Chainsaw.  You can then run Chainsaw as follows:

[*nix]
sh target/appassembler/bin/chainsaw

[Windows]
target/appassembler/bin/chainsaw.bat

[OSX]
You can use the *nix steps above, or go one extra step for a nicer OSX experience

mvn package appbundler:bundle

This will create an OSX distribution, look inside the target folder for the packaged OSX application and .dmg distribution.  You can drag the application to your /Applications folder, or just double click it from the target folder.

For log4j developers
====================

Creating a Webstart distribution
================================

To create the Webstart distribution requires:
	* a keystore configured with a valid code signing key
		I've always found this link useful:
			http://www.dallaway.com/acad/webstart/
			
	* A maven profile that defines the parameters for code signing (otherwise passwords and stuff need to be embedded in the pom.xml)
	 	Edit your ${user.home}/.m2/settings.xml file, such that it has something like:

		<settings>
		....
		<profiles>
		....
		  <profile>
		 	<id>chainsaw-signing</id>
		    <properties>
		      <chainsaw.webstart.keystore>/somepath/keystore</chainsaw.webstart.keystore>
		      <chainsaw.webstart.keypass>somesupersecurepassword</chainsaw.webstart.keypass>
		      <chainsaw.webstart.storepass>someothersupersecurepassword</chainsaw.webstart.storepass>
		      <chainsaw.webstart.alias>aliasofcertificateinkeystore</chainsaw.webstart.alias>
		    </properties>
		  </profile>
		...
		</profiles>
		....
		</settings>
		
	Then create the webstart package:
	
	mvn -Pchainsaw-signing install webstart:jnlp
	
	Inside the target folder will contain a .zip file containing the webstart distribution, including the generated .jnlp file.
