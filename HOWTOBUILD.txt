HOWTOBUILD.txt
==============

For General Users
=================
Firstly, you'll need maven 2.0.4+ to build Chainsaw:

http://maven.apache.org

Once setup, 

mvn install

This will automatically build and assemble the Chainsaw distribution which includes a .sh & .bat shell script to run Chainsaw:

[*nix]
sh target/appassembler/bin/chainsaw

[Windows]
target/appassembler/bin/chainsaw.bat

[OSX]
You can use the *nix steps above, or go one extra step for a nicer OSX experience

mvn package appbundler:bundle

This will create an OSX distribution, look inside the target folder for the packaged OSX applicationd and .dmg distribution.  You can drag the application to your /Applications folder, or just double click it from the target folder.
