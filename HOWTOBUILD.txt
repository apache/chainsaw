==============

This document outlines the steps required to build and run log4j Chainsaw v2.

Comments/Changes/Bugs for this document and build process: 
  * Log4j Developers list (log4j-dev@logging.apache.org)


Assumptions
===========
* Familiar with Ant, and have it installed (http://ant.apache.org/) 
  (requires the 1.5.x series of Ant, including Conditions support)

Dependencies
============

Chainsaw requires:

* log4j1.3 full jar
* jakarata ORO 2.0.6+

Optionally, you can add Jakarta Commons VFS, and it's dependencies to have extra features inside Chainsaw
See http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/sandbox/vfs/ for more information

Simply placing all the dependant jars inside the directory specified by the 'deps.dir' build property (lib by default)
will get you going.


Step-by-Step to build Chainsaw
======================================

1. Download logging-chainsaw (you've probably already done this if you're reading
   this...)

2. Copy the build.properties.sample file -> build.properties

3. Edit the build.properties file and modify to suit your needs.  

4. Download and install the dependancies and place the jars in the directory specified by the 'deps.dir' in 
   the build.properties file.
   
## NOT CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTED
##4. If you haven't downloaded the required dependencies outlined in the build.properties file
##   there is an ant target to help you:
##   
##   ant getdeps
##   
##   This will download all the required jars for Chainsaw v2 and place them in the directory
##   specified in build.properties (it's the deps.dir property, usually ./lib)
   
5. After you have all the dependencies From the logging-log4j root directory, type:

      ant chainsaw
    
   That's it ;)
