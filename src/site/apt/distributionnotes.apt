Important Distribution Notes

	Due to Java classloading rules, it is impossible to ship the Jakarta Commons VFS extension to Chainsaw OR have DBReceiver or JMSReceiver bundled with Chainsaw.
	
	Several VFS filestore implementation jars cannot be shipped with Chainsaw because of licensing issues, and for JMSReceiver and DBReceiver you are required
	to have proprietary driver jars locally which we obviously can't ship. You can follow these steps to enable the DB, JMS and/or VFS components inside Chainsaw.
		
		[[1]] [DBReceiver] Download the {{{http://logging.apache.org/log4j/docs/webstart/chainsaw/lib/log4j-db-1.3alpha-7.jar}DB extension}} to Chainsaw
		
		[[2]] [JMSReceiver] Download the {{{http://logging.apache.org/log4j/docs/webstart/chainsaw/lib/log4j-jms-1.3alpha-7.jar}JMS extension}} to Chainsaw
		
		[[3]] [VFS] Download the {{{http://logging.apache.org/log4j/docs/webstart/chainsaw/lib/log4j-chainsaw-vfs.jar}VFS extension}} to Chainsaw
		
		[[4]] [VFS] Download {{{http://people.apache.org/builds/jakarta-commons/nightly/commons-vfs/}VFS}}
		
		[[5]] [VFS] Download {{{http://commons.apache.org/downloads/download_logging.cgi}Commons Logging}} Jars
		
		[[6]] [VFS] Download the VFS {{{http://commons.apache.org/vfs/download.html}filestore implementation jars}} you wish to use
		
			
	Place all these jars in your .chainsaw/plugins directory (the .chainsaw directory is in your home directory)
	Start Chainsaw, which should now recognize the existence of these components and allow you to use them.
		
	This applies to all distributions.
